# LibraryWebsite-PHP
This repository contains a Library Website and database which i created for my Web Development 2 
module assignment in my second year studying Computer Science.

The website was written in PHP and used phpMyAdmin to run and store the databases 
associated with the site.

This repository contains the PHP files required to run the website, a CSS file which is used 
throughout the site and the SQL required to create the database associated with the site.

(SQL was generated by exporting the database I created in phpMyAdmin)
